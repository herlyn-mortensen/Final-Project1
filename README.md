# Final-Project1

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Data is crucial not just for assessing the global impact of COVID-19, but also for informing appropriate reaction, planning, and resource allocation. The pandemic has highlighted the value of data more than anything else.

Covid-19 Updates aims to provide updated data of confirmed Covid-19 cases and vaccine rate per country. It can cater to the general public users, the government, especially the tourism sector. Given that data organization is its foundation, it would deliver a systematized flow of information to the user. As a result, it helps provide information about how a country is doing in terms of the Corona virus infection and protection. 

The data structure should be easy to understand for general public users, and the site should be able to provide country filters, a bar chart for confirmed cases, and a pie chart for vaccine rates - stating the completely vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and non-vaccinated per country.

### FIVE PLANES OF UX/UI

**FIGMA [LINK](https://www.figma.com/file/TDyAQ5QuwsHfsVkufzZtzk/Project-1?node-id=0%3A1)** :circus_tent:

1. Strategy
- The site exists to give Covid-19 updates, specifically the number of confirmed cases per day and vaccine rates per country. Data should be both accessible for website and mobile use.
2. Scope
- The site gives the number of confirmed cases a day per country, as well as the percentage of fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated and unvaccinated per country.
- Users can select which country they want to check.
3. Structure
- Sites contain live data of Covid-19 confirmed cases and vaccine rates.
- The confirmed cases data can be viewed when clicking the “Check Countries” button on the start page, which can then be filtered by selecting which country the user wants to check.
- Vaccine updates can be viewed on the navigation bar.
- Information about the symptoms as well as prevention can also be found in the navigation bar.
4. Skeleton
- Elements are designed on multiple pages format with navigation bar.
- Users will first see a landing page with the website logo and illustration up front.
- Users will also see a navigation bar with the website logo. Navigation bar turns into a burger button for mobile use.
- Vaccine update page on the navigation bar contains data about the vaccination percentage rate per country.
- Symptoms page on the navigation bar contains text information about symptoms of Covid-19.
- Prevention page on the navigation bar contains text information about preventive measures towards Covid-19.
- Information and data are all easy to navigate and view as it follows proper website format. 
5. Surface
- Fonts used are Abril Fatface and Poppins as the ease of reading is the most important.
- Red color signifies virus and alertness. It was used for the primary color of the site/app.
- Font awesome icons are also used to designate specific elements such as green bullet check points.
- Illustrations are also used to convey the text information better.


### FEATURES

The interactive charts on the site are the major feature, allowing the visitor to observe different numeric data on Covid-19 instances and vaccine rate. It also has a drop down menu where you may select different countries and project data from the selected one.

With pending implementations, the site has plans on adding a global map feature with colors contrasts and descriptions that shows which countries have high covid rates, high vaccine rates and travel information. It can also feature the latest news and articles on potential new vaccines and developments against Covid-19 as well as other potential new viruses and variants. 

For the bugs and limitations, I find that I can’t create a default country that the chart can show before I even select another country on the drop down menu.
